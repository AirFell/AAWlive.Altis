/*
Resources logic:

Each base will have its own resource variable.

Example:
HQ_West_1_Resources = X

Each player will have a credit variable.

Example:
player credits = X

Each resource crate will have a name, and a corresponding value:
resourceBarrel (100 resources/100 credits)



This will be cumulative and be saved on the server.
An area trigger will be added to an area by the HQ Tower that players can set
resource crates into.

When a player moves a resource crate into the area, the trigger will then add
the resource crates value of resources to the HQ resource variable, and a
corresponding amount of credits to the players individual credit variable.

At the top of the HQ tower will be an infostand for each function of the HQ,
these infostands will at as an access panel for each base building once its
been built.

Each Access panel will access and display the local base resources, upgrade cost
(if available), and resource cost for generating units (specific to each factory).
