fix distance between towers: create public variable of towers in an array, building a tower appends the list and publicVar's it
then a foreach loop checking distance between position and tower position, and if less than 2500, adds 1 to a counter.
if the counter is less than 0 it builds, else hint too close to another tower.

fix findsafe pos: code works on tower 2, needs to be added to all other towers, and possibly other things
that use FindSafePos

need markers for create vehicle location,deposit vehicle location,repair vehicle location(helipad will do all the for choppers)
need logic for making base fortification materials.
need logic for banking at main base

need dialog for barracks/armory, need dialog for vehicle factory. Possibly a new learning expierence?
inside vehicle factory dialog I need HEMTT's for building FOB's (Towers 2,3, and 4)

remove/diable create fob truck from dialog when one exists


OLD SHIT:::
set up other base parts, test trigger to create

attach dialogs to infostands (addaction scripts)
display base resources on infostand dialogs (dynamic text)

turn on and configure R3F

Set up "resource crates"

attach deposit resources button to dialog

make deposit/withdraw resources script
SUGGESTION: Make area trigger or something then do a foreach of type resource crate,
delete crate,
if (crate size(small/med/LG)) add resouces to base resource var
and add credits to players credit variable

attach withdraw resources button to dialog....

GUI displaying Players Credits, status of MOB, FOB2, FOB3, FOB4


//////////////////
//"polish" stuff:
//////////////////
3d markers on infostands, depositories, other stuff

fix positioning of created base parts

set colors to addactions (build MOB for side color)

finish configuring R3F for specific vehicles tow/can be towed ect...

finish setting up base parts (barracks, factory)

re-skin HEMTT's for sides (Blue, Red, Green)

prevent base HEMTT's from being put in depots
