=============

Preface:

  Having been a big fan of BSS' "Project Reality", I loved the tactical realism of it all. The setting up FOB's, the logistics, the tension during the wait and the action when it all comes together. Later, the DayZ ARMA 2 mod provided that same feel to a degree, but with the added despiration of a zombie apocalypse.

  Playing DayZ mod with some of my closest RL and online friends, we had been thrilled, but lost the fun once you had geared up to "max level". There was nothing left to do but mindlessly kill, or start over for fun. This led us to Tonic's and Sa-Matra's wasteland variants. The missions gave us something more to do, the teamwork we desired was there, and it still had that bit of despair. The base building was nice, but bases had little actual function to them, and once being geared to the teeth, there was nothing to do but go bust up enemy bases or prevent the enemy from getting better gear from the missions.
  
  Other DayZ style mods, Wasteland type missions are all fun, but what we really want with AAW is something a bit more coesive military style logistics, strategy and tactics while keeping the NEED for gear/vehicles and something to do in the long term.


What is ARMA At WAR?:

  AAW is a multiplayer mission for ARMA 3 on altis that features military-style base building, and resource collection to supply/run bases.
  
  There are three teams, Blufor, Opfor and Indi teams. Each team is balanced with the same gear except for uniforms.
  
  
How do I play AAW?:

  Each team starts with random spawns on an area of the map for their team. Each random spawn area covers about 3 sq km of beach space, going slightly inland. In that spawn area there is a HEMTT truck that is used to deploy a Main Operating Base tower. Once the MOB tower is built, it needs resources to be deposited in it.(More on resources later)
  
  After a base has been loaded up with resources, players can then start to upgrade the tower to have things like a barracks, vehicle factory, a radar station, and player-placeable fortifications and defenses.
  
  Each of the base upgrades (barracks, vehicle factory, ect...) can also be upgraded to provide more options. The Barracks starts out as a spawn location, but upgrading profides new player classes such as Medic, Sniper, Pilot ect.. The vehicle factory gives more vehicle types that can be purchased.
  
  
How do Resources work?:

  Resources are what AAW revolves around. Resources are metal oil barrels that spawn with missions and at various locations around the world. Once your team has built a base tower, resources can be placed in a marked area next to it and deposited. When a player deposits an oil barrel they will also recieve credits for their efforts.
  
  Building and upgrading base parts costs resources, as well as buying vehicles, weapons, and uniform kits. But, buying vehicles and weapons/uniforms also costs credits. This prevents players from just wasting resources that their team worked hard for.
  
  Resource barrels can also be withdrawn from a base (say to put into another base), but this will cost a player more credits than they would get for depositing them.
  
  
How do Bases work in AAW?:

  Starting out each team can build a Main Operations Base. Once they have built a vehicle factory for the MOB, they can now buy three more HEMTT trucks that can build three more bases, called Forward Operations Bases (FOB). These bases are very similar to the MOB, but don't have a vehicle factory.
  
  From the FOB three more smaller "disposable" outposts can be built. These don't allow further upgrades, but can be used for vehicle/weapon storage, vehicle repairs, and have a small radar station attached.
  
  Bases cannot be placed within a certain distance from another base- friendly or enemy.
